# Prediction-of-Employee-Retention

Companies spend lot of assets, cash and time to train their employees to get the best results. Acquiring a new employee can become costly in both time and money matters. Employee retention is very important. But if the employee quits the company due to some reason it is a great loss for the company. We will tell you how to predict and retain an employee in the company
One of the ways how to keep employees from leaving is :
a)To analyze why people who left the company decided to do so
b)To predict who could be leaving next and try to take preemptive action.

Among all the company related problems which the companies are experiencing, retaining an employee has become another greater problem.
Employee turnover has become important particularly with the increase in the demand for professional employees. Understanding why employees leave the company is very important. This will help companies to increase the efficiency and reduce training cost which turns into greater profit. So can we predict future terminations? If so, how well can we predict?
Retaining employees of a company is known as Retention.
Retention rate is the percentage of employees retained during certain period. It is better to have higher retention rate.
Losing employees of a company is known as Attrition. Attrition rate is the percentage of employees leaving the company for one reason or the other. It is better to have lower attrition rate. Machine learning is the solution. By making data analysis, one can take steps to prevent employees from leaving the company(attrition). HR needs to start thinking outside of traditional thinking and methodologies. Algorithms which are accurate solves the problem by giving accurate predictions.

The main objective of this project is to find attributes for predicting attrition and use it for retaining employees, to know the valuable employee, to select the retention factors to predict attrition and retention, to find the best algorithm to do the prediction, to help the HRs to improve retention rate of valuable employees.
